# How to use?
## Step 1: Clone the Repository
**Fork or Clone the Original Repository**: If the original repository is available on GitHub and allows forking, you can fork it. Alternatively, you can clone it directly to your local machine using Git. For forking, use the GitHub interface. For cloning, use:
```
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/tobwil/markdown_website
```
**Create Your Own Repository**: If you forked the repository, you already have a copy on your GitHub account. If you cloned it, create a new repository on GitHub and push the cloned content to your new repository.

## Step 2: Customize the Website
**Update Repository Links**: In the JavaScript code, change the baseUrl variable to point to your own GitHub repository:
```
javascript
Copy code
const baseUrl = "https://api.github.com/repos/[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name]/contents/";
Modify Content: Replace the existing content with your own. This includes updating Markdown files in the 'posts', 'projects', and 'listening' directories.
```
**Adjust HTML and CSS**: Customize the HTML and CSS files to match your personal branding, style preferences, and content layout. Update titles, headings, and links.

**Customize JavaScript**: Modify the JavaScript as needed to suit your content structure and interactivity preferences.

## Step 3: Add Content
**Create Markdown Files**: Add your own Markdown files in the respective folders (posts, projects, listening) in your GitHub repository. These files should contain the content you want to display on your website.

**Commit and Push Changes**: After adding or updating the content, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository:
```
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push origin master
```
