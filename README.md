**Hello and welcome to my [personal website](https://emilygorial1.github.io/EmilyGorial1/)!**

I created this website by initially searching online for Github website templates. I came across Jekyll which is a static site generator that can transform plain text into a website. After spending some time trying to understand how to use Jekyll for my website, and not feeling very satsified with the free website themes offered on Jekyll, I decided it may be better to take a different route. 

I did some more research and stumbled upon [this](https://github.com/tobwil/markdown_website) repository created by Tobias wilhelm that could be cloned and customized. I decided to go with this option as I am already familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I cloned the repository and got to work on personalizing my website. From there, I pushed my changes to Github and was able to publish my website.
